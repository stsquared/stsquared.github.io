We are She and They do Science and Tech (STST), or ST-squared for short. We're a group of women and non-binary people in STEM research, specializing in data analytics and software development, looking to help uplift and support gender minorities in our disciplines.

We are located in Galway, Ireland, hosted at the Data Science Institute-- the iteration of Science Foundation Ireland's Insight Centre for Data Analytics affiliated with the University of Galway.

We will be hosting workshops and skillshares in the west of Ireland, starting February 22nd, 2023.
