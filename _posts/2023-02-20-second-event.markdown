Our second event will be taking place this upcoming Wednesday, February 22nd, 2023, from 1-4pm at the Data Science Insititute in the IDA Business Park.

The event is a workshop focused on helping participants get comfortable with "thinking like a programmer," and will provide modules on problem-solving, computational thinking, and algorithmic exercises.

Registration is currently full at 30 participants, but we may add a few more seats and look to a larger venue in the future.
